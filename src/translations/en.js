        title: 'Blowout Removal',
        description: 'Intervention to correct or smooth blowouts — a tissue deformity that arises mainly when the lobe is stretched inadequately: too fast advancement, incorrect jewelry, or excessive pressure (such as sleeping with the stretcher). Treatment includes technical evaluation, necessary adjustments, possible jewelry changes, and specific guidance to recover the harmony and natural contour of the lobe.'

      coinslot: {
        title: 'Coinslot',
        description: 'Procedure that creates a small continuous opening in the cartilage, allowing the use of multiple rings after healing. The name coinslot refers to the slot where coins are placed in coin machines — a clear allusion to the final shape of the modification. This aesthetic cannot be achieved with just several separate piercings, because anatomy and healing limit the space between them. Coinslot is a precise technique with fast healing, and in about 30 days it is already possible to place the rings, always respecting the appropriate size for your anatomy.'

      jewelryMaintenance: {
        title: 'Jewelry Maintenance',
        description: 'With time of use — especially when jewelry stays for long periods without being removed — it is normal for residues to accumulate in the settings, behind the stones, and in the internal parts of the jewelry. Therefore, we offer complete maintenance with deep cleaning in an ultrasonic tank, reaching areas that cannot be cleaned at home. This care restores the original shine, leaves the stones impeccably clean, and makes the jewelry look new again. Chic, safe, and performed with all the care and Vermelho Sangue standard.'

      downsize: {
        title: 'Downsize',
        description: 'Downsize is the adjustment of the post length after the first phase of healing. When the initial swelling decreases, the long post is no longer necessary — and keeping it can cause irritations, friction, and even angulation of the piercing. Performing downsize at the appropriate time is essential to ensure healthy, stable, and aesthetically aligned healing. At Vermelho Sangue, we closely monitor this process so your piercing evolves with safety and comfort.'
