GALLERY PAGE DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

PAGE OVERVIEW
-------------
Create a brand new page for the website called "Gallery"
- Include Header and Footer (same as other pages)
- Page should be accessible via routing

DATA SOURCE
-----------
- All images and media will be sourced from: pictures_index.txt
- Categories available:
  * PIERCINGS
  * MODIFICAÇOES CORPORAIS (Body Mods)
  * LOBULOPLASTIA
  * PERFURAÇOES GENITAIS (Genital Piercings)

LAYOUT STRUCTURE
----------------
1. Header (standard site header)
2. Filter Section (below header)
3. Gallery Grid (below filter)

FILTER SECTION
--------------
Filter Options:
- ALL (shows all images from all categories)
- PIERCINGS (shows only piercing images)
- BODY MODS (shows only body modification images)
- LOBULOPLASTY (shows only lobuloplasty images)
- GENITAL PIERCINGS (shows only genital piercing images)

Filter Requirements:
- Filter functionality: When a filter is selected, gallery grid displays only images from that category
- Smooth animation when changing filters (images should transition smoothly)
- Filter styling and behavior should be similar to the "my works" section filter from the VITORCACHOEIRA folder project
- Filter should be positioned below the header

GALLERY GRID
------------
Grid Specifications:
- Display: Grid layout that fits the whole screen horizontally
- Columns: 6 images per row
- Frame Type: Equal squared frames
- Spacing: No borders/gaps between frames (frames are together)
- Frame Size: All frames must have the same size
- Media Placement: Media links from pictures_index.txt will be placed in the frames

Grid Behavior:
- Similar to picture grids on homepage and piercings page
- Instead of 3 slots per row, this will have 6 per row
- Images should fill their frames completely
- Grid should be responsive (adjust for mobile/tablet)

ANIMATIONS
----------
- Smooth animation when changing filters
- Images should transition smoothly when filter changes
- Consider fade in/out or other smooth transitions

TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------
- Use React Router for page routing
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Grid should be responsive (mobile-friendly)
- Images should load efficiently
- Consider lazy loading for performance

REFERENCE
---------
- Filter styling/behavior: Similar to "my works" section filter from VITORCACHOEIRA project
- Grid layout: Similar to homepage and piercings page grids (but 6 columns instead of 3)
